# Komodo-CANN Ascend C Kernel

This directory contains the repository-owned Ascend C implementation for the
optional Komodo-CANN W4A16 custom operator. It is intentionally separate from
plain Komodo and from the `aclnnWeightQuantBatchMatmulV3` probe.

The current device kernel is a bring-up baseline for GPTQ W4A16:

- Input activations are FP16 `[M, K]`.
- Packed weights use Komodo's CANN INT4 pack, physically `int32 [K, N / 8]`.
- Scales and offsets are FP16 `[groups, N]`.
- Output is FP16 `[M, N]`.
- Supported group sizes are `0`, `32`, `64`, and `128`.

The kernel deliberately does not materialize a full dense FP16 weight matrix in
GM or L2. The validated baseline uses one writing AI Core, stages a 64-value
INT4-to-FP16 dequant tile in UB, consumes that tile immediately for the current
accumulation, and writes only the final output. This is not yet the final
high-throughput Cube-tiled design; it is the first custom-op baseline needed
before reintroducing multi-core tile ownership and replacing the scalar
accumulation loop with Cube tile consumption.

Build from the repo root:

```bash
python scripts/build_komodo_cann_ascendc.py \
  --output /tmp/komodo_cann_w4a16_op
```

Use `--no-build` to generate and overlay the project without invoking CMake.
The helper calls `msopgen` with
`gptqmodel_ext/komodo_cann/op_ir/komodo_cann_w4a16_matmul.json`, overlays the
files in this directory, and then runs the generated `build.sh`.
